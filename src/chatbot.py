"""
Companion Bot - Final version focused problem collector & sharp wrap-up
install these pip install openai SpeechRecognition pyaudio TextBlob
Features:
 - ENTER to toggle background speech listening (if microphone available)
 - Typed input fallback
 - Collects user's primary problem, then focuses replies specifically on that problem
 - Relationship (breakup/cheating) and job-betrayal flows have tailored advice
 - Detects suicidal language and asks "how long" — prompts assessment/escalation if needed
 - Suggests PHQ-9 / GAD-7 when duration or sentiment suggests
 - Problem-phase limited to a few focused steps (configurable)
 - Wrap-up summary & 4-5 actionable plan at wind-up threshold (30-40 messages)
 - Minimal hardcoded keys per user instruction (replace with env vars if desired)
